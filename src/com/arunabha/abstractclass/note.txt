Abstract class:
    any class that contains one or more abstract method must be declared abstract class.
    abstract method: part of abstract class.
                     tells the child class what to do, not how to do.
                     function is declared but not defined.

    if we know that methods of the parent class will be overridden, make it abstract.
    abstract class objects cannot be created.
    abstract constructor cannot be created.
    static methods do not get overridden. so static methods cannot be abstract.
    but we can create static method in abstract class.
    an abstract class can extend another abstract class.

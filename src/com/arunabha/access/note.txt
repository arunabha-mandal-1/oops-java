use cases
    1. public: accessed everywhere e.g. we want main function to be accessed everywhere
    2. protected: we want to use these members outside the class if the class we are using it in is a subclass; only subclass can access not the superclass
    3. default: for members we don't want to use outside the particular package
    4. private: it is for sensitive data that we don't want direct access to; accessed via getter and setter

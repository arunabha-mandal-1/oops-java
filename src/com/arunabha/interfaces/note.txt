Interface:
    contains only abstract function that are public by default.
    variables are static and final(cuz final variables are always initialized) by default in interface.
    what the class is doing not how it's doing.
    u cannot create objects of the interfaces.

    abstract class can provide implementation of an interface.
    interface cannot provide implementation of an abstract class.

    u can implement multiple interfaces together.
    an interface can extend other interfaces.

    achieved multiple inheritance by interfaces.

    u should be careful not to use interfaces casually in performance critical codes.

    only 'public' and 'static' access modifiers are allowed here

    @annotations are internally interfaces

    top level can be public or default.

    but nested interfaces can be public, protected, default, private.

    interfaces provide a common protocol that allows different software components to communicate with each other.

Encapsulation:
    wrapping up the implementations of data members and methods in a class.
    writing up code of that encapsulated thing is providing us abstraction.
    encapsulation is solving an implementation level issue.
    encapsulation focuses on the internal working.
    it's a process of containing information.


    making something private is called data hiding

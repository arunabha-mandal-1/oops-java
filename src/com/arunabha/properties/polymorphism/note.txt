Polymorphism:
    poly = many
    morphism = way to represent
    > many ways to represent a single item or entity
    e.g. a task is performed as a single action but in different ways.
    any language that does not support polymorphism is not object-oriented language; they are known as object basis language. java supports polymorphism.
    it occurs during inheritance.

    creating different constructor is also polymorphism;

Types :
    1. compile time/static polymorphism: achieved via method/operator overloading.(java does not provide operator overloading)
                                         e.g. multiple constructor
                                         java determines which method should call at compile time.

    2. runtime/dynamic polymorphism: achieved by method overriding(same function properties but body is different).

Types of inheritance:
    1. single inheritance: one class extends another class.
    2. multilevel inheritance: one can inherit another class that can another class.
                               upper classes does not have access to the lower ones but lower ones have access to the upper ones.
    3. multiple inheritance: one class is extending more than one class.
                             class C extends class B and class A.
                             suppose there is variable 'n' in both A(n=10) and B(n=20).
                             then which value C should take??
                             that's why java does not support multiple inheritance.
                             java does this via interfaces.
    4. hierarchical inheritance: one class is inherited by many classes.
                                 class A, B, C inherit class D
    5. hybrid inheritance: combination of single and multiple inheritance.
                           java does not support this.
                           done via interfaces.
                           class B, C extend A(single); class D extends class B, C(multiple)

note : a class can not inherit itself.
